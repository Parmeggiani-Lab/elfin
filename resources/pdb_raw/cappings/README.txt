These pdb contain terminal repeats from DHR models
They have either Ncap + 1 internale repeat (NI) or 1 internal repeat + Ccap (IC)
These can be used for superposition with designs in elfin to add caps

The repeats file contains DHR in the elfin database, although 8 is not used because of lack of junctions.
The numbers refer to the beginning and end of the two internal repeats

repeats_all_DHR contains all the DHR instead with internal repeats defined

There are also capping repeats for ank modules, containg as well the internal capping repeat, still as NI and IC.
ank_NI: Ncap 2-29 Internal 30-62
ank_IC: Internal 96-128 Ccap 129-158
